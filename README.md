Currently just an svg map of pre-2017 Calgary ward boundaries.

Forced-directed draggable polygons in /drag, based on: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1073373

Experimenting with placing svg geopaths in non-map contexts.

Maybe join some candidate registration information in the run-up to the 2017 Calgary municipal election.
